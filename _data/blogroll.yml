    Kartikay is a software engineer, but his <a href="https://kartikay.bearblog.dev/blog/">Personal-Blog</a> is more interesting to me. He posts short essays on life, learning, struggle, written in a very thoughtful and concise style. I particularly liked <a href="https://kartikay.bearblog.dev/productivity/" target="_blank">Productivity</a>, and <a href="https://kartikay.bearblog.dev/next-step/">Take The Next Step</a>, which both told me what I already knew, but in a new way, and a way that might stick.
