## Introduction

I am a photonics engineer with seven years experience developing integrated photonics components (and occasionally free-space optics) for use in telecommunications, biological sensing, EUV lithography, non-traditional computing and trapped-ion quantum processor units. I've decided to give that up in favour of pursuing a career in something that has caught my eye in the last couple of years, AI (alright, it caught my eye a decade ago with Nick Bostrom's [Superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies), but I was only interested in alignment theory back then).

Over the last two years I have spent a lot of time teaching myself software engineering and machine learning, going through [Jeremy Howard's](https://x.com/jeremyphoward?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) [fasti.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) course, the famous [Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) and [CS231n](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/2016/) lectures, as well as countless other materials and doing mini coding projects along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes on this journey, and I hope to make many more mistakes (better and faster mistakes) in the future.

This blog was inspired by Simon Willison's [TIL blog](https://til.simonwillison.net/) (who was in turn inspired by John Branchaud TIL blog idea, comprehensively discussed in [How I built a Learning Machine](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9)). I want to document my learning and force myself to pay more attention to what I'm learning, in the spirit of [Michael Nielsen's](https://x.com/michael_nielsen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) quote on the [Conversations with Tyler](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/michael-nielsen/) podcast:

> Any general-purpose strategy you have which will cause you to pay attention to the world is incredibly valuable, so I collect things like that.

Yes. Yes!

I am committing to posting 3-5 TIL's per week, with the stretch goal of posting something every day. There is great power in streaks.
