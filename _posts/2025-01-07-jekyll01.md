Jekyll is a statis site generator written in `Ruby`. It takes text content (in the form of `Markdown`, .md, files) and templates (`HTML` layouts) and converts them into a complete static website that can be served without a backend or database.

Once you have set up the boilerplate (still a slighty non-trivial matter for a noob like me, not not too difficult, especially for a bare-bones setup) all you have to do is add .md files to `_posts/` and any linked images/video/audio etc. to `assets/` and run the command `bundle exec jekyll serve`, and the static site html is automatically generated and hosted locally on your machine. You can then easily push this repo to Github and have it hosted on Github Pages for free!
