The end is nigh. The beginning is nigh. What does it reveal about your approach to something when it always feels like you are at the beginning, or always in the middle, or always at the end? Perspective as usual is everything.

History is coming back, prophesies are coming true, trends are reversing, and above it all circles the spectre of AGI, the wild card, the all bets are off, flip the table over, no one knows what's coming over that horizon, card.

At this critical moment (which moments are not critical?) we must look back, but only so we can look forwards! Reflection is for two things, nostalgia, and planning. Nostalgia can be entertaining and can generate a powerful schmood when it hits just right, but if that's where it ends, it is naval gazing and distraction. This is a world of technique, and the past is a tool to realign ourselves again and again, constantly making course corrections and adjustments.

The telos of this blog is to reflect _practically_ and _deliberately_.

You do not have to go to the woods to live deliberately, you can do it here and now. I ask that you try to read deliberately, or don't read at all. There is so to do in this world. Make a decision to do something, and do it deliberately. Do not live haphazardly or at random, buffetted through life by someone elses fate. Find your own path or make one. You have only yourself to blame.
