After reading Xuanwo's [40 questions to myself](https://xuanwo.io/2025/01-2024-review/) (inspired by [Steph Ango's](https://stephango.com) [40 questions to ask yourself each year](https://stephango.com/40-questions)) I decided to have a go myself. Steph Ango also has [40 questions to ask yourself each _decade_](https://stephango.com/40-questions-decade) but I'm not up to that just yet. Here goes...

**1. What did you do this year that you’d never done before?**

I visited Japan, with my girlfriend and 9 month old (at the time) son. We visited for 2 weeks at the start of August, for a friend's wedding in Kamakura, and travelled to Kamakura, Kyoto, Nara, Hiroshima and Tokyo. It was stiflingly hot (up to 39 °C in high humidity), but unbelievably beautiful. The sky was so blue, the shrines so red, the trees so green, everything had an ethereal dreamlike quality. For a westerner who had never travelled further east than Marmaris, Turkey, it was like travelling to an alien world, and then travelling back to Europe was like being thrown out of paradise into a semi-hell. I love Japan.

Unemployment and lack of a secure future is hardship enough.

**11. Did you suffer illness or injury?**

No.

**12. What was the best thing you bought?**

- [Take On Me (MTV Live Unplugged)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xKM3mGt2pE), one of the most beautiful songs that I have ever heard, that had to wait over 35 years since the original release to be born into this world.

[The Detectorists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgN7z0SD8v8), which is so wonderfully British and wholesome. We watched it in 2023 but I can’t think of a single show I watched in 2024?
