Amending `PATH` (something arcane that exists in "system variables" on windows that I had always been a bit afraid of) allows you to call scripts in a particular directory from anywhere on your system. All the programs/functionaly that normally work in the terminal (`cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `python` etc.) have to be placed _somewhere_ that the terminal can find them. Otherwise you're just shouting into the void and computer says no, I don't know what that is.

On MacOS and Linux (and probably windows too), the `PATH` variable is actually incredibly simple, and can be easily and safely edited. In this example, I edit the `PATH` to add my `crypto-prices` directory, so when I call the bash function `crypto.sh`, the shell knows what I'm talking about.

## Step 1. Editing the PATH Variable

Edit the `PATH` in `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
open ~/.zshrc
```

Add the line `export PATH="PATH:$HOME/Documents/Code/scratch/cryptoprices` somewhere in `.zshrc`. This defines a new `PATH`, but to stop the previous `PATH` from being overwritten you must prepend the path to your new directory with `PATH`. Alternatively you can add your new directory to the end of a long `PATH` string, deliminated by `:`, with `$PATH` at the end, e.g.:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/libexec/bin:$HOME/code/scratch/crypto-prices:$PATH"
```

which lists in order all the directories the shell will look for programs/commands entered into the terminal.

## Bash and Python Files of Interest

I have three scripts and one `venv/` directory in `$HOME/code/scratch/crypto-prices` directory of interest here (`$HOME` expands to the user's home directory):

1. _crypto.sh_ - bash script that activates the venv, checks the script arguments, determines which python file to run and runs it with user arguments
2. _simple.py_ - python script that prints the current crypto prices for BTC, ETH, LINK, DOT, ADA using the Binance API
3. _complete.py_ - does the same as _simple.py_ but with added functionality for calculating wallet amounts and printing the all-time-highs
4. _venv/_ - directory storing the virtual environment in which the python library `requests` is installed.

The full, heavily commented, _crypto.sh_ script is as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# The first line, the "shebang," tells the system which interpreter to use for the script.

# Set the path to the virtual environment directory.
# "VENV_PATH" is a variable storing the full path to the virtual environment.
VENV_PATH="$HOME/code/scratch/crypto-prices/venv"

# Check if the virtual environment exists by testing if the "activate" script is present.
# "-f" checks if a file exists and is a regular file (not a directory).
if [ -f "$VENV_PATH/bin/activate" ]; then
    # "source" runs the file in the current shell, activating the virtual environment
    source "$VENV_PATH/bin/activate"
else
    # If the file doesn't exist, print an error message and exit the script with a status of 1 (indicating failure).
    echo "Error: Virtual environment not found at $VENV_PATH"
    exit 1
fi

# Check if at least one argument is provided when running the script.
# "$#" represents the number of arguments passed to the script. "-lt 1" means "less than 1".
if [ "$#" -lt 1 ]; then
    # If no arguments are provided, print usage instructions to help the user.
    # "$0" refers to the name of the script itself (e.g., ./crypto.sh).
    echo "Usage: $0 <script_name> [script_args]"
    echo "Available scripts: simple, complete"
    exit 1
fi

# Store the first argument (the script name) in the variable "SCRIPT_NAME".
# "$1" is the first positional argument passed to the script.
SCRIPT_NAME=$1

# "shift" removes the first argument from the list of positional arguments ($1), shifting all others down.
shift

# Here "$@" (all arguments as a single space-separated string) will only additional script arguments (if any).
# Store the remaining arguments (after removing the first) in the variable "SCRIPT_ARGS".
SCRIPT_ARGS="$@"

# Use a "case" statement to map the script name provided by the user to the actual Python script file.
# The "case" construct is like a switch statement in other languages.
case $SCRIPT_NAME in
    # If the user specifies "simple" as the script name, set "SCRIPT_PATH" to the corresponding file path.
    simple)
        SCRIPT_PATH="$HOME/code/scratch/crypto-prices/simple.py"
        ;;
    # If the user specifies "complete," set "SCRIPT_PATH" to a different file path.
    complete)
        SCRIPT_PATH="$HOME/code/scratch/crypto-prices/complete.py"
        ;;
    # If the script name doesn't match any of the predefined options, handle it as an error.
    *)
        # Print an error message and remind the user of the available options.
        echo "Unknown script name: $SCRIPT_NAME"
        echo "Available scripts: simple, complete"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

# Run the selected Python script using the Python interpreter from the virtual environment.
# "$SCRIPT_PATH" is the full path to the Python script determined earlier.
# "$SCRIPT_ARGS" contains any additional arguments passed by the user.
python "$SCRIPT_PATH" $SCRIPT_ARGS

# Deactivate the virtual environment to restore the shell's environment to its previous state.
deactivate
```

I can now run the `simple` and `complete` scripts globally:

```bash
$ crypto.sh complete -ath
