# The TIL Blog

This is the TIL Blog. It is inspired by Simon Willison's [TIL blog](https://til.simonwillison.net/), which was in turn inspired by Josh Branchaud's idea to post mini TIL posts to help him document his learning for himself and others (and build a portfolio of his learnings). Josh Branchaud has a good post [How I built a Learning Machine](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9) and over 1500 TILs on his github repo [til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til). Another notable TIL blogger is [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/).
